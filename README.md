# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction
Company bankruptcy prediction involves using financial data, market trends, and economic indicators to forecast whether a company is likely to go bankrupt. This process typically includes gathering financial metrics like debt-to-equity ratios and profitability, preprocessing data, and applying machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks. 

The goal is to identify patterns that indicate financial distress and help predict future insolvency, often using evaluation metrics like accuracy and precision to measure the model's performance.
